Thanks to everyone reading today! My project I will be talking about today, is a CLI data gem that lists and gives information on all of the Star Wars movies released to date. If you're curious when the movie was released or who the director and/or producer was this app is perfect for you, and of course to add a little spice and nostalgia to it all, within every movie description there is the opening crawl!


**Why did I choose Star Wars?**

Well as a kid growing up, it wasnt a choice rather a task to watch these with my dad. As I grew older I became more inclined to love the saga and choose to watch them all on my own. As I was searching for an API to use I told myself I wanted to create an app pertaining to something I loved or else it would just be stale to me.

**Languages and resources used.**

In this program I used my skills and knowledge of Ruby, github and HTTParty. I used the learn sandbox to write and run my code, unfortunately for this project I was unable to use Visual Studio Code. I would like to use VSC in the future as it seems to be the most elaborate program for writing code.

**What does it do?**

What does the program do exactly? Well this program uses an API to gather data from a website and implements it into a CLI application. It gets information on all the Star Wars movies realeased and gives you a little bit of information on each one! 

When a user opens the program they'll be prompted with an option to list all movies. Or if they're maybe a Harry Potter fan instead, they can simply exit! But for those, who are cool and with the program let's go ahead and check those movies out! 

```
______________________________________

1 - Star Wars: A New Hope
______________________________________

2 - Star Wars: Attack of the Clones
______________________________________

3 - Star Wars: The Phantom Menace
______________________________________

4 - Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith
______________________________________

5 - Star Wars: Return of the Jedi
______________________________________

6 - Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back
______________________________________

7 - Star Wars: The Force Awakens
```

Voil√† and just like that you have all the movies in front of you and their information at your finger tips! Want to know the director and producer of 'A New Hope'? Just select the unique number for select movie and there it'll be! 

**Road Blocks and Problems had.**

For me, most of the issues I had with this project were within my own head. I battled anxiety and doubt almost all the way through. I told myself I didn't know enough, or I wasn't able to do it... once I got around that and got started it all seemed to piece together. 

A problem I had within the code, was when my menu was pulling it would pull and I could only select 1-6 and for some reason 7 was coming back with and error code. I was stumped on this for about 5-6 hours alone! With the help of a couple people from another cohort I got passed it and we figured it out! 

**Where to next?**

What would I like to do with this program next? How would I like to add to it in the future? When there's no deadline, I would personally like to add more movie series to my menu! Try and mimick IMDB to an extent. You could choose between a multitude of movies and sagas to get information on! Whether it's Harry Potter or Fast and the Furious, this app will have the information for you! 

But for now, we've just got Star Wars... but I think that's a good place to start!

Thank you for your time! Hope you enjoyed my first ever program!
