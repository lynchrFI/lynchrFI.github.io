Hello everyone! Today I can say, I have checked off another box in my flatiron journey. It has been a very interesting, challenging, but exciting ride so far.As we come to a close on our 3rd section I am falling more in love with developing every day. I will say though, I have felt like dropping the course at times, but I’ve also felt like I was on top of the world learning this stuff! With this project, I feel like I have a application that I can use in my every day life.


# About My Project
To start off, the name of my project is "Precision Auto Detailing"... boring, right? The reason I chose to this app is because personally, I need to have some sort of desire about the apps I work on. On the side, I detail cars for a living and figured this would be something I would use that could help me in my business ventures. With this application you have the ability to create clients as they come in, schedule appointments for them and keep track of their personal preferences. Such as, how they prefer to be contacted, what types of services they look for, if they have pets and tend to have a lot of hair to clean out. I plan on implementing many front end features to simply make the webiste pop!

# How Does It Work? (Road blocks I ran into)
With this project I think one of my biggest challeneges was making sure I was practicing DRY coding. I had some issues at the start with simply, doing too much work. I would second guess myself on a lot of features I wanted to add, and the best, most logical way of going about things. 
```
 1. Build a user authentication system.
 2. Build an app with one resource having full CRUD functionality.
 3. Build a has_many and belongs_to relationship between models as well as two has_many_through. My application has three models, User, Client, and Appointments I accomplished this by allowing a user to have many clients and have many clients through appointments, and a client has many users through appointments. All while an appointment belongs to a user and a client


 My Future in Development With my struggles and my excitement with everything leading up to this point it makes me that much more excited to see what is coming next. I cannot wait to see what’s next and where this journey takes me, to all other Jr. devs out there… cheers!```
