Hello everyone! Today I have the honor of saying, I have completed my second project. It has been a very interesting, challenging, but exciting ride so far. As our second chapter comes to a close I can definitely say it's been a wild ride so far. I have felt like dropping the course at times, but I've also felt like I was on top of the world learning this stuff! With this project, I was finally at a point where I felt like I was able to show it off to my friends.

# About My Project 

To start off, the name of my project is Lynch's Game Reviews! Video games have helped me through some of the darkest times in my life and has made me some friends as well. I like to spend free time and unwinding my day on gaming, whether it's League of Legends, or some nice relaxing WoW grinding, I figured if I wanted a project I would enjoy working on it should pertain to one of my hobbies! With this application, you're allowed to go in and write and store reviews for any game  you would like, it allows you to edit that game if you would like to change any errors, and it also allows you to delete it if you are just not satisfied. 

# How Does it Work? (Road blocks I ran into) 
With this project I think one of my biggest challenges was, really getting going. I just sat for awhile not knowing where to go. So at this point I just asked myself, what do I enjoy the most? And proceeded from there! Once I got my idea planted it all seemed to come together. The main requirements for the project were:

              1. Build a user authentication system.
              2. Build an app with one resource having full CRUD functionality.
              3. Build a has_many and belongs_to relationship between models.

My application has two models, User and Review. I accomplished the task of has_many by allowing users to "have many" reviews, but reviews to "belong to" one user. Therefore, any user cannot go in and delete the others reviews.
In order to help me write the program and get to the ultimate goal I used a few gems to help me out with that! 

             1. Sinatra (Domain Specific Language to Ruby for creating web applications).
             2. ActiveRecord (Used for mapping database tables to Ruby classes).

# My Future in Development
With my struggles and my excitement with everything leading up to this point it makes me that much more excited to see what is coming next. This is only our second project and I was already proud enough of something to go out and share with friends! I cannot wait to see what's next and where this journey takes me, to all other Jr. devs out there... cheers!
