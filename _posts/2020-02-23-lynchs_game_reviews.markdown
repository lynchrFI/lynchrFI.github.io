Hello everyone! Today I have the honor of saying, I have completed my second project. It has been a very interesting, challenging, but exciting ride so far. As our second chapter comes to a close I can definitely say it's been a wild ride so far. I have felt like dropping the course at times, but I've also felt like I was on top of the world learning this stuff! With this project, I was finally at a point where I felt like I was able to show it off to my friends.

# About My Project 

To start off, the name of my project is Lynch's Game Reviews! Video games have helped me through some of the darkest times in my life and has made me some friends as well. I like to spend free time and unwinding my day on gaming, whether it's League of Legends, or some nice relaxing WoW grinding, I figured if I wanted a project I would enjoy working on it should pertain to one of my hobbies! With this application, you're allowed to go in and write and store reviews for any game  you would like, it allows you to edit that game if you would like to change any errors, and it also allows you to delete it if you are just not satisfied.
